## command prompt "cd" doesn't work? add /d after cd, eg
cd /d d:\Docs\Java

## Problems with push

create a new repo in guthub
go to local folder and do "git init"
git remote add origin (with your repo url) // simply copy from your repo
git add -A
git commit -m "your commit"
git push -u origin master
